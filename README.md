Transform your Raspberry Pi into a powerful LoRaWAN Node with our plug-and-play HAT featuring the RAK3172 module and TFT display. This provides a convenient and versatile solution for accelerating your IoT development projects with LoRaWAN networks. You can easily switch onboard module into LoRaWAN Mode for connecting with server platforms like The Things Network (TTN), Chirpstack, Actility, etc. or P2P Mode to implement your own customized long-range LoRa network quickly. Module complies with Classes A, B, and C of the LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specifications.

This Github provides getting started guide for LoRaWAN Raspberry Pi HAT Node.

 * Download and setup your Raspberry Pi with OS, you can follow the Getting Started [Link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) to perform OS installation.
 * You will have to enable Serial and SPI interface in Raspberry Pi, find instruction [here](https://github.com/sbcshop/Pitalk_4G_HAT_Software/blob/main/Documents/Serial%20Interface%20Enable%20RPi.pdf) 
 * Download complete github to Raspberry Pi,
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_HAT_Node_Software.git
   ```
